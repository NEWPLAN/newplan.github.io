# Research Interests
My research interests fall in Networked Computer Systems, with special focuses on:
<ul>
	<li><strong>High-Performance Networked Systems</strong>, including explorations of emerging communication technologies (e.g., RDMA) and  optimizations for efficient scheduling to simplify, speed up the data communication at scale</li>
	<li><strong>Distributed Machine Learning Systems</strong>, searching for the system-level optimizations with the codesign of communication and computation to speed up the communication- and computation-intensive applications.</li>
</ul>
